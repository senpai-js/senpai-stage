# senpai-stage

This library is meant to be consumed by anyone who wants to use sprites on a canvas using the `Stage` class, or script visual novels using the `Interpreter` class. Please feel free to join the conversation on our small discord server located [here](https://discord.gg/Rm7TQKu).

Some of the repos are out of date, and all the work is currently focused on getting the view layer up to par. If you would like to contribute, please don't hesitate to ask for help!
